Purpose:

The purpose of this database is to allow the Sparkify to quickly analyze data across millions of rows in their song database.

How to run scripts in order:

1. create_tables.py
2. etl.py

Explanation of files:

create_tables.py initiates the DB structure for loading.
etl.py performs transformations then loads the data into the DB.
test.ipynb checks tables for accuracy of structure and content
etl.ipynb checks on a small amount of data loading successfully into the DB.

Justification:

The star schema allows for data modeling and easier to read queries.
